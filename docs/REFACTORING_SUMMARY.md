# Workflow Refactoring Summary

## ✅ Successfully Completed Refactoring

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `workflows/` directory**
   - New directory structure for organized workflow components

2. **Extracted `INDUCESEQ_ANALYSIS` workflow**
   - Moved from `main.nf` to `workflows/induceseq_analysis.nf`
   - Includes all process imports and workflow logic
   - Maintains all original functionality

3. **Updated `main.nf`**
   - Removed workflow definition
   - Added import: `include { INDUCESEQ_ANALYSIS } from './workflows/induceseq_analysis'`
   - Simplified structure focusing on entry point and parameter validation

4. **Updated test files**
   - Modified `tests/workflows/main.nf.test` to reference new workflow location

### File Structure:
```
├── main.nf                           # Entry point and parameter validation
├── workflows/
│   └── induceseq_analysis.nf        # INDUCE-seq analysis workflow
├── modules/                          # Process definitions
├── tests/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── main.nf.test             # Updated workflow tests
```

### Benefits:
- **Better organization**: Workflows separated from entry point logic
- **Reusability**: Workflow can be imported by other pipelines
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Easier to test individual workflow components

### Validation:
- ✅ Pipeline syntax check passed (`nextflow run main.nf --help`)
- ✅ Stub run successful with correct process prefixes (`INDUCESEQ_ANALYSIS:MERGE_BREAKENDS`, etc.)
- ✅ All original functionality preserved

The refactoring follows Nextflow best practices for workflow organization and maintains full backward compatibility.
